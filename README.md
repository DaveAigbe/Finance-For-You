# Finance-For-You
Project for HackDFW 2022


## Inspiration

We live in a society where our media consumption is increasing and our need for instant gratification is ever-growing. However, we don't give ourselves enough time to learn about the generational wisdom of financial freedom and retirement plans because it feels farfetched. We want to take advantage of the new generations' incredible speed of information gathered and leverage it to introduce the knowledge of finance.

## What it does

Our product strives to automatically create short clips of popular financial advice found on popular social media platforms and deliver them in an environment where users can easily access and consume concise information. If the user seeks to learn additional information from the short clip, they will have the opportunity to learn more about it as it will navigate them to full video access.

## How we built it

We sketched our idea into a notebook to express our design and functionalities. With 2 developers and 1 QA member, we were able to create a mini agile environment to create a quick deployment of our model and to get instant feedback. Our application is built on a react-native library with, videos being stored in the AWS cloud database for universal access.

## Challenges we ran into

- Our lack of exposure to react-native and its configurations
- Implementing our thoughts into functional code

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We time-boxed ourselves to measure our progress in learning the react-native library and we successfully created a functioning mobile application.
What we learned

From our arduous yet fruitful journey, we learned to allocate our time and filter out unnecessary noise to meet the demands of the problem. We also learned to separate our responsibilities to effectively communicate and overcome hurdles.

## What's next for Finance For You

We would like to refine and redesign our UI to be more intuitive and responsive. Furthermore, we would like to create our own segment clipping algorithm to aid content creators in reaching the rising market for short video clips.
